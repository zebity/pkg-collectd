collectd.conf \- Configuration for the system statistics collection daemon \fBcollectd\fR
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 3

.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This config file controls how the system statistics collection daemon
\&\fBcollectd\fR behaves. The most significant option is \fBLoadPlugin\fR, which
controls which plugins to load. These plugins ultimately define collectd's
behavior.
.PP
The syntax of this config file is similar to the config file of the famous
\&\fBApache Webserver\fR. Each line contains either a key-value-pair or a
section-start or \-end. Empty lines and everything after the hash-symbol `#' is
ignored. Values are either string, enclosed in double\-quotes,
(floating\-point\-)numbers or a boolean expression, i.\ e. either \fBtrue\fR or
\&\fBfalse\fR. String containing of only alphanumeric characters and underscores do
not need to be quoted.
.PP
The configuration is read and processed in order, i.\ e. from top to
bottom. So the plugins are loaded in the order listed in this config file. It
is a good idea to load any logging plugins first in order to catch messages
from plugins during configuration. Also, the \f(CW\*(C`LoadPlugin\*(C'\fR option \fBmust\fR occur
\&\fBbefore\fR the \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin ...>\*(C'\fR block.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fBBaseDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "BaseDir Directory"
Sets the base directory. This is the directory beneath all RRD-files are
created. Possibly more subdirectories are created. This is also the working
directory for the daemon.
.IP "\fBLoadPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "LoadPlugin Plugin"
Loads the plugin \fIPlugin\fR. There must be at least one such line or \fBcollectd\fR
will be mostly useless.
.IP "\fBInclude\fR \fIPath\fR" 4
.IX Item "Include Path"
If \fIPath\fR points to a file, includes that file. If \fIPath\fR points to a
directory, recursively includes all files within that directory and its
subdirectories. If the \f(CW\*(C`wordexp\*(C'\fR function is available on your system,
shell-like wildcards are expanded before files are included. This means you can
use statements like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Include "/etc/collectd.d/*.conf"
.Ve
.Sp
To prevent loops and shooting yourself in the foot in interesting ways the
nesting is limited to a depth of 8\ levels, which should be sufficient for
most uses. Since symlinks are followed it is still possible to crash the daemon
by looping symlinks. In our opinion significant stupidity should result in an
appropriate amount of pain.
.Sp
It is no problem to have a block like \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin foo>\*(C'\fR in more than one
file, but you cannot include files from within blocks.
.IP "\fBPIDFile\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "PIDFile File"
Sets where to write the \s-1PID\s0 file to. This file is overwritten when it exists
and deleted when the program is stopped. Some init-scripts might override this
setting using the \fB\-P\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fBPluginDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "PluginDir Directory"
Path to the plugins (shared objects) of collectd.
.IP "\fBTypesDB\fR \fIFile\fR [\fIFile\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "TypesDB File [File ...]"
Set one or more files that contain the data-set descriptions. See
\&\fItypes.db\fR\|(5) for a description of the format of this file.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Configures the interval in which to query the read plugins. Obviously smaller
values lead to a higher system load produced by collectd, while higher values
lead to more coarse statistics.
.IP "\fBReadThreads\fR \fINum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ReadThreads Num"
Number of threads to start for reading plugins. The default value is \fB5\fR, but
you may want to increase this if you have more than five plugins that take a
long time to read. Mostly those are plugin that do network\-IO. Setting this to
a value higher than the number of plugins you've loaded is totally useless.
.IP "\fBHostname\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hostname Name"
Sets the hostname that identifies a host. If you omit this setting, the
hostname will be determinded using the \fIgethostname\fR\|(2) system call.
.IP "\fBFQDNLookup\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "FQDNLookup true|false"
If \fBHostname\fR is determined automatically this setting controls whether or not
the daemon should try to figure out the \*(L"fully qualified domain name\*(R", \s-1FQDN\s0.
This is done using a lookup of the name returned by \f(CW\*(C`gethostname\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Using this feature (i.\ e. setting this option to \fBtrue\fR) is recommended.
However, to preserve backwards compatibility the default is set to \fBfalse\fR.
The sample config file that is installed with \f(CW\*(C`make\ install\*(C'\fR includes a
line which sets this option, though, so that default installations will have
this setting enabled.
.SH "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
.IX Header "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
Some plugins may register own options. These options must be enclosed in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR\-Section. Which options exist depends on the plugin used. Some plugins
require external configuration, too. The \f(CW\*(C`apache plugin\*(C'\fR, for example,
required \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR to be configured in the webserver you're going to
collect data from. These plugins are listed below as well, even if they don't
require any configuration within collectd's configfile.
.PP
A list of all plugins and a short summary for each plugin can be found in the
\&\fI\s-1README\s0\fR file shipped with the sourcecode and hopefully binary packets as
well.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""apache"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWapache\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin apache"
To configure the \f(CW\*(C`apache\*(C'\fR\-plugin you first need to configure the Apache
webserver correctly. The Apache-plugin \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR needs to be loaded and
working and the \f(CW\*(C`ExtendedStatus\*(C'\fR directive needs to be \fBenabled\fR. You can use
the following snipped to base your Apache config upon:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  ExtendedStatus on
\&  <IfModule mod_status.c>
\&    <Location /mod_status>
\&      SetHandler server\-status
\&    </Location>
\&  </IfModule>
.Ve
.PP
Since its \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR module is very similar to Apache's, \fBlighttpd\fR is
also supported. It introduces a new field, called \f(CW\*(C`BusyServers\*(C'\fR, to count the
number of currently connected clients. This field is also supported.
.PP
The following options are accepted by the \f(CW\*(C`apache\*(C'\fR\-plugin:
.IP "\fB\s-1URL\s0\fR \fIhttp://host/mod_status?auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "URL http://host/mod_status?auto"
Sets the \s-1URL\s0 of the \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR output. This needs to be the output generated
by \f(CW\*(C`ExtendedStatus on\*(C'\fR and it needs to be the machine readable output
generated by appending the \f(CW\*(C`?auto\*(C'\fR argument.
.IP "\fBUser\fR \fIUsername\fR" 4
.IX Item "User Username"
Optional user name needed for authentication.
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIPassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password Password"
Optional password needed for authentication.
.IP "\fBCACert\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "CACert File"
File that holds one or more \s-1SSL\s0 certificates. If you want to use \s-1HTTPS\s0 you will
possibly need this option. What \s-1CA\s0 certificates come bundled with \f(CW\*(C`libcurl\*(C'\fR
and are checked by default depends on the distribution you use.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""apcups"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWapcups\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin apcups"
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Hostname"
Hostname of the host running \fBapcupsd\fR. Defaults to \fBlocalhost\fR. Please note
that IPv6 support has been disabled unless someone can confirm or decline that
\&\fBapcupsd\fR can handle it.
.IP "\fBPort\fR \fIPort\fR" 4
.IX Item "Port Port"
TCP-Port to connect to. Defaults to \fB3551\fR.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""cpufreq"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWcpufreq\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin cpufreq"
This plugin doesn't have any options. It reads
\&\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq\fR (for the first \s-1CPU\s0
installed) to get the current \s-1CPU\s0 frequency. If this file does not exist make
sure \fBcpufreqd\fR (<http://cpufreqd.sourceforge.net/>) or a similar tool is
installed and an \*(L"cpu governor\*(R" (that's a kernel module) is loaded.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""csv"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWcsv\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin csv"
.IP "\fBDataDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "DataDir Directory"
Set the directory to store CSV-files under. Per default CSV-files are generated
beneath the daemon's working directory, i.\ e. the \fBBaseDir\fR.
.IP "\fBStoreRates\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "StoreRates true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, convert counter values to rates. If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default) counter values are stored as is, i.\ e. as an increasing integer
number.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""df"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWdf\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin df"
.IP "\fBDevice\fR \fIDevice\fR" 4
.IX Item "Device Device"
Select partitions based on the devicename.
.IP "\fBMountPoint\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "MountPoint Directory"
Select partitions based on the mountpoint.
.IP "\fBFSType\fR \fIFSType\fR" 4
.IX Item "FSType FSType"
Select partitions based on the filesystem type.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
Invert the selection: If set to true, all partitions \fBexcept\fR the ones that
match any one of the criteria are collected. By default only selected
partitions are collected if a selection is made. If no selection is configured
at all, \fBall\fR partitions are selected.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""dns"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWdns\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin dns"
.IP "\fBInterface\fR \fIInterface\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interface Interface"
The dns plugin uses \fBlibpcap\fR to capture dns traffic and analyses it. This
option sets the interface that should be used. If this option is not set, or
set to \*(L"any\*(R", the plugin will try to get packets from \fBall\fR interfaces. This
may not work on certain platforms, such as Mac\ \s-1OS\s0\ X.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSource\fR \fIIP-address\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSource IP-address"
Ignore packets that originate from this address.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""email"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWemail\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin email"
.IP "\fBSocketFile\fR \fIPath\fR" 4
.IX Item "SocketFile Path"
Sets the socket-file which is to be created.
.IP "\fBSocketGroup\fR \fIGroup\fR" 4
.IX Item "SocketGroup Group"
If running as root change the group of the UNIX-socket after it has been
created. Defaults to \fBcollectd\fR.
.IP "\fBSocketPerms\fR \fIPermissions\fR" 4
.IX Item "SocketPerms Permissions"
Change the file permissions of the UNIX-socket after it has been created. The
permissions must be given as a numeric, octal value as you would pass to
\&\fIchmod\fR\|(1). Defaults to \fB0770\fR.
.IP "\fBMaxConns\fR \fINumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "MaxConns Number"
Sets the maximum number of connections that can be handled in parallel. Since
this many threads will be started immediately setting this to a very high
value will waste valuable resources. Defaults to \fB5\fR and will be forced to be
at most \fB16384\fR to prevent typos and dumb mistakes.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""exec"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWexec\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin exec"
Please make sure to read \fIcollectd\-exec\fR\|(5) before using this plugin. It
contains valuable information on when the executable is executed and the
output that is expected from it.
.IP "\fBExec\fR \fIUser\fR[:[\fIGroup\fR]] \fIExecutable\fR [\fI<arg>\fR [\fI<arg>\fR ...]]" 4
.IX Item "Exec User[:[Group]] Executable [<arg> [<arg> ...]]"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBNotificationExec\fR \fIUser\fR[:[\fIGroup\fR]] \fIExecutable\fR [\fI<arg>\fR [\fI<arg>\fR ...]]" 4
.IX Item "NotificationExec User[:[Group]] Executable [<arg> [<arg> ...]]"
.PD
Execute the executable \fIExecutable\fR as user \fIUser\fR. If the user name is
followed by a colon and a group name, the effective group is set to that group.
The real group and saved-set group will be set to the default group of that
user. If no group is given the effective group \s-1ID\s0 will be the same as the real
group \s-1ID\s0.
.Sp
Please note that in order to change the user and/or group the daemon needs
superuser privileges. If the daemon is run as an unprivileged user you must
specify the same user/group here. If the daemon is run with superuser
privileges, you must supply a non-root user here.
.Sp
The executable may be followed by optional arguments that are passed to the
program. Please note that due to the configuration parsing numbers and boolean
values may be changed. If you want to be absolutely sure that something is
passed as-is please enclose it in quotes.
.Sp
The \fBExec\fR and \fBNotificationExec\fR statements change the semantics of the
programs executed, i.\ e. the data passed to them and the response
expected from them. This is documented in great detail in \fIcollectd\-exec\fR\|(5).
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""hddtemp"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWhddtemp\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin hddtemp"
To get values from \fBhddtemp\fR collectd connects to \fBlocalhost\fR (127.0.0.1),
port \fB7634/tcp\fR. The \fBHost\fR and \fBPort\fR options can be used to change these
default values, see below. \f(CW\*(C`hddtemp\*(C'\fR has to be running to work correctly. If
\&\f(CW\*(C`hddtemp\*(C'\fR is not running timeouts may appear which may interfere with other

.PP
The \fBhddtemp\fR homepage can be found at
<http://www.guzu.net/linux/hddtemp.php>.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHostname\fR" 4

TCP-Port to connect to. Defaults to \fB7634\fR.
.IP "\fBTranslateDevicename\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "TranslateDevicename true|false"
If enabled, translate the disk names to major/minor device numbers
(e.\ g. \*(L"8\-0\*(R" for /dev/sda). For backwards compatibility this defaults to
\&\fItrue\fR but it's recommended to disable it as it will probably be removed in
the next major version.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""interface"""
.el .Sh "Plugin \f(CWinterface\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin interface"

a more detailed description see \fBIgnoreSelected\fR below.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
If no configuration if given, the \fBtraffic\fR\-plugin will collect data from
all interfaces. This may not be practical, especially for loopback\- and
similar interfaces. Thus, you can use the \fBInterface\fR\-option to pick the
interfaces you're interested in. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred
to collect all interfaces \fIexcept\fR a few ones. This option enables you to
do that: By setting \fBIgnoreSelected\fR to \fItrue\fR the effect of
\&\fBInterface\fR is inversed: All selected interfaces are ignored and all
other interfaces are collected.

Select the rules to count. If only \fITable\fR and \fIChain\fR are given, this plugin
will collect the counters of all rules which have a comment\-match. The comment
is then used as type\-instance.
.Sp
If \fIComment\fR or \fINumber\fR is given, only the rule with the matching comment or
the \fIn\fRth rule will be collected. Again, the comment (or the number) will be
used as the type\-instance.

.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
If no configuration if given, the \fBirq\fR\-plugin will collect data from all

can use the \fBIrq\fR\-option to pick the interrupt you're interested in.
Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred to collect all interrupts \fIexcept\fR a
few ones. This option enables you to do that: By setting \fBIgnoreSelected\fR to

and all other interrupts are collected.
.ie n .Sh "Plugin ""libvirt"""

This plugin allows \s-1CPU\s0, disk and network load to be collected for virtualized

Refresh the list of domains and devices every \fIseconds\fR. The default is 60
seconds. Setting this to be the same or smaller than the \fIInterval\fR will cause
the list of domains and devices to be refreshed on every iteration.

When the libvirt plugin logs data, it sets the hostname of the collected data

useful on its own because all guests will appear to have the same name.

You can also specify combinations of these fields. For example \fBname uuid\fR

Instruct the plugin to collect interface statistics. This is basically the same
as the statistics provided by the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin (see above) but
potentially much more detailed.
.Sp
When configuring with \fBInterface\fR only the basic statistics will be collected,
namely octets, packets, and errors. These statistics are collected by
the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin, too, so using both at the same time is no benefit.
.Sp
When configured with \fBVerboseInterface\fR all counters \fBexcept\fR the basic ones,

This includes dropped packets, received multicast packets, collisions and a

.PD
Collect the octets and packets that pass a certain qdisc, class or filter.
.Sp
QDiscs and classes are identified by their type and handle (or classid).
Filters don't necessarily have a handle, therefore the parent's handle is used.
The notation used in collectd differs from that used in \fItc\fR\|(1) in that it
doesn't skip the major or minor number if it's zero and doesn't print special
ids by their name. So, for example, a qdisc may be identified by
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfifo_fast\-1:0\*(C'\fR even though the minor number of \fBall\fR qdiscs is zero and
thus not displayed by \fItc\fR\|(1).
.Sp
If \fBQDisc\fR, \fBClass\fR, or \fBFilter\fR is given without the second argument,
i.\ .e. without an identifier, all qdiscs, classes, or filters that are
associated with that interface will be collected.
.Sp
Since a filter itself doesn't necessarily have a handle, the parent's handle is
used. This may lead to problems when more than one filter is attached to a
qdisc or class. This isn't nice, but we don't know how this could be done any
better. If you have a idea, please don't hesitate to tell us.
.Sp
As with the \fBInterface\fR option you can specify \fBAll\fR as the interface,
meaning all interfaces.

Here are some examples to help you understand the above text more easily:

The \fBServer\fR statement sets the server to send datagrams \fBto\fR.  The statement
may occur multiple times to send each datagram to multiple destinations.
.Sp
The \fBListen\fR statement sets the interfaces to bind to. When multiple

The argument \fIHost\fR may be a hostname, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. If
the argument is a multicast address the daemon will join that multicast group.
.Sp
If no \fBListen\fR statement is found the server tries join both, the default IPv6
multicast group and the default IPv4 multicast group. If no \fBServer\fR statement
is found the client will try to send data to the IPv6 multicast group first. If
that fails the client will try the IPv4 multicast group.
.Sp
The default IPv6 multicast group is \f(CW\*(C`ff18::efc0:4a42\*(C'\fR. The default IPv4
multicast group is \f(CW239.192.74.66\fR.

.IX Item "TimeToLive 1-255"
Set the time-to-live of sent packets. This applies to all, unicast and
multicast, and IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The default is to not change this value.
That means that multicast packets will be sent with a \s-1TTL\s0 of \f(CW1\fR (one) on most
operating systems.
.IP "\fBForward\fR \fItrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "Forward true|false"
If set to \fItrue\fR, write packets that were received via the network plugin to
the sending sockets. This should only be activated when the \fBListen\fR\- and
\&\fBServer\fR\-statements differ. Otherwise packets may be send multiple times to
the same multicast group. While this results in more network traffic than
necessary it's not a huge problem since the plugin has a duplicate detection,
so the values will not loop.

For each host/plugin/type combination the \f(CW\*(C`network plugin\*(C'\fR caches the time of
the last value being sent or received. Every \fISeconds\fR seconds the plugin
searches and removes all entries that are older than \fISeconds\fR seconds, thus
freeing the unused memory again. Since this process is somewhat expensive and
normally doesn't do much, this value should not be too small. The default is
1800 seconds, but setting this to 86400 seconds (one day) will not do much harm
either.

etc.) some values may still be in the cache. If \fBCacheFlush\fR is set, then the
entire cache is searched for entries older than \fBCacheTimeout\fR seconds and
written to disk every \fISeconds\fR seconds. Since this is kind of expensive and
does nothing under normal circumstances, this value should not be too small.
900 seconds might be a good value, though setting this to 7200 seconds doesn't
normally do much harm either.
.IP "\fBCacheTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CacheTimeout Seconds"
If this option is set to a value greater than zero, the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool plugin\*(C'\fR will
save values in a cache, as described above. Writing multiple values at once

a virtual environment such as Xen, in which case the \s-1UUID\s0 is preserved across
shutdowns and migration.
.PP
The following methods are used to find the machine's \s-1UUID\s0, in order:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Check \fI/etc/uuid\fR (or \fIUUIDFile\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
Check for \s-1UUID\s0 from \s-1HAL\s0 (<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal>) if
present.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Check for \s-1UUID\s0 from \f(CW\*(C`dmidecode\*(C'\fR / \s-1SMBIOS\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Check for \s-1UUID\s0 from Xen hypervisor.
.PP
If no \s-1UUID\s0 can be found then the hostname is not modified.
.IP "\fBUUIDFile\fR \fIPath\fR" 4
.IX Item "UUIDFile Path"
Take the \s-1UUID\s0 from the given file (default \fI/etc/uuid\fR).

This plugin doesn't have any options. \fBVServer\fR support is only available for
Linux. It cannot yet be found in a vanilla kernel, though. To make use of this
plugin you need a kernel that has \fBVServer\fR support built in, i.\ e. you
need to apply the patches and compile your own kernel, which will then provide
the \fI/proc/virtual\fR filesystem that is required by this plugin.
.PP
The \fBVServer\fR homepage can be found at <http://linux\-vserver.org/>.
.SH "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
Starting with version \f(CW4.3.0\fR collectd has support for \fBmonitoring\fR. By that
we mean that the values are not only stored or sent somewhere, but that they
are judged and, if a problem is recognized, acted upon. The only action
collectd takes itself is to generate and dispatch a \*(L"notification\*(R". Plugins can
register to receive notifications and perform appropriate further actions.
.PP
Since systems and what you expect them to do differ a lot, you can configure
\&\fBthresholds\fR for your values freely. This gives you a lot of flexibility but
also a lot of responsibility.
.PP
Every time a value is out of range a notification is dispatched. This means
that the idle percentage of your \s-1CPU\s0 needs to be less then the configured
threshold only once for a notification to be generated. There's no such thing
as a moving average or similar \- at least not now.
.PP
Also, all values that match a threshold are considered to be relevant or
\&\*(L"interesting\*(R". As a consequence collectd will issue a notification if they are
not received for twice the last timeout of the values. If, for example, some
hosts sends it's \s-1CPU\s0 statistics to the server every 60 seconds, a notification
will be dispatched after about 120 seconds. It may take a little longer because
the timeout is checked only once each \fBInterval\fR on the server.
.PP
Here is a configuration example to get you started. Read below for more
information.

There are basically two types of configuration statements: The \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks select the value for which a threshold should be
configured. The \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks may be specified further using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Instance\*(C'\fR option. You can combine the block by nesting the blocks, though
they must be nested in the above order, i.\ e. \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR may contain either
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks, \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR may only contain \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR may not contain other blocks. If multiple blocks apply to the same
value the most specific block is used.
.PP
The other statements specify the threshold to configure. They \fBmust\fR be
included in a \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR block. Currently the following statements are recognized:
.IP "\fBFailureMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMax Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMax Value"
.PD
Sets the upper bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to positive
infinity. If a value is greater than \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification
will be created. If the value is greater than \fBWarningMax\fR but less than (or
equal to) \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBFailureMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMin Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMin Value"
.PD
Sets the lower bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to negative
infinity. If a value is less than \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification will
be created. If the value is less than \fBWarningMin\fR but greater than (or equal
to) \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBInvert\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Invert true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR the range of acceptable values is inverted, i.\ e.
values between \fBFailureMin\fR and \fBFailureMax\fR (\fBWarningMin\fR and
\&\fBWarningMax\fR) are not okay. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBPersist\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Persist true|false"
Sets how often notifications are generated. If set to \fBtrue\fR one notification
will be generated for each value that is out of the acceptable range. If set to
\&\fBfalse\fR (the default) then a notification is only generated if a value is out
of range but the previous value was okay.
.Sp
This applies to missing values, too: If set to \fBtrue\fR a notification about a
missing value is generated once every \fBInterval\fR seconds. If set to \fBfalse\fR
only one such notification is generated until the value appears again.
