=head1 NAME

types.db - Data-set specifications for the system statistics collection daemon
B<collectd>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  bitrate    value:GAUGE:0:4294967295
  counter    value:COUNTER:U:U
  if_octets  rx:COUNTER:0:4294967295, tx:COUNTER:0:4294967295

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The types.db file contains one line for each data-set specification. Each line
consists of two fields delimited by spaces and/or horizontal tabs. The first
field defines the name of the data-set, while the second field defines a list
of data-source specifications, delimited by spaces and, optionally, a comma
(",") right after each list-entry.

The format of the data-source specification has been inspired by RRDtool's
data-source specification. Each data-source is defined by a quadruple made up
of the data-source name, type, minimal and maximal values, delimited by colons
(":"): I<ds-name>:I<ds-type>:I<min>:I<max>. I<ds-type> may be either
B<COUNTER> or B<GAUGE>. I<min> and I<max> define the range of valid values for
data stored for this data-source. If B<U> is specified for either the min or
max value, it will be set to unknown, meaning that no range checks will
happen. See L<rrdcreate(1)> for more details.

=head1 FILES

The location of the types.db file is defined by the B<TypesDB> configuration
option (see L<collectd.conf(5)>). If you want to specify custom data-sets, you
should do so by using a custom file specified as an additional argument to the
B<TypesDB> option.
