============================================================
http://verplant.org/liboping/

About
-----

  liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
  existing solutions in that it can `ping' multiple hosts in parallel using
  IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object oriented
  interface, simplicity and extensibility.


Features
--------

  * Support for multiple hosts.

  * Support for IPv4 and IPv6.

  * Object oriented interface.
