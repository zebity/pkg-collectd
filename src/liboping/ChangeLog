2006-06-05, Version 0.2.2
	* The `oping' application didn't exit if no hosts could be resolved.
	  This release fixes it's behavior.

2006-06-01, Version 0.2.1
	* Fix the behavior for non GNU-Linux systems. liboping tried to
	  `bind(2)' to the raw-socket it uses to send ICMP packets. Apparently
	  (decided by majority vote ;) this is not the right thing to do.
	  GNU/Linux never complained about it, but works find without the bind.
	  Other operating systems don't work at all with the bind.
	* Build fixes for non-GNU/Linux platforms: Mac OS X doesn't define
	  `size_t' as `unsigned int' and therefore needs casting and FreeBSD
	  needs to have `sys/types.h' included before `netinet/*.h'

2006-05-29, Version 0.2.0
	* It's now possible to set the data to be send to the remote host and
	  to get the data received from the host.
	* The `oping' binary now calculates the standard deviation. Also, it
	  displays the number of byes that were received and other output
	  changes.
	* Hosts are now returned in the same order as they were added by
	  `ping_host_add'. This is not guaranteed, but makes `oping' prettier.

2006-05-12, Version 0.1.1
	* A bug in the library has been fixed: When the sequence got higher
	  than 2^16 the counter in the packets wrapped around, but the
	  internal counter didn't, causing the library to ignore all further
	  ICMP packets. This affected both, ICMPv4 and ICMPv6.

2006-05-08, Version 0.1.0
	* Initial release.
