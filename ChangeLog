2006-07-19, Version 3.10.1
	* A bug in the apcups plugin was fixed: Is the plugin is loaded, but
	  the apcups cannot be reached, unconnected sockets will pile up and
	  eventually lead to `Too many open files' errors.

2006-07-09, Version 3.10.0
	* The `disk' plugin has been ported to Darwin.
	* The `battery' plugin should work on many Apple computers now.
	* The `traffic' plugin can now ignore certain interfaces. Also,
	  statistics for sent/received packets and errors have been added.
	* A plugin to monitor APC UPSes using `apcupsd' has been added. Thanks
	  to Anthony Gialluca for contributing this plugin and providing me
	  with a test environment :)
	* A plugin for moniroting an NTP instance and the local clock drift
	  has been added.

2006-06-25, Version 3.9.4
	* The Solaris code in the `swap' plugin has been changed to reflect
	  the numbers returned by `swap -s'. Thanks to Christophe Kalt for
	  working this out.
	* The debugging system has been fixed to work with the Sun libc.
	* When built without librrd the variable `operating_mode' could be
	  uninitialized. Thanks to David Elliot for reporting the bug.

2006-06-01, Version 3.9.3
	* Fixed the ping-plugin under FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Potentially other
	  operating systems also profit from the changes, but I wasn't able to
	  check that.
	* Changed the build system to find the netinet-includes under FreeBSD
	  and therefore successfully build the `liboping' library there.

2006-05-09, Version 3.9.2
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-05-09, Version 3.8.5
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-04-21, Version 3.9.1
	* Build issues with Solaris and possible other architectures have been
	  resolved.
	* Problems when building the `apache'-plugin without `libcurl' have
	  been resolved.
	* A bug in the `ping' plugin has been fixed. Sorry folks.

2006-04-02, Version 3.9.0
	* A plugin to monitor the Apache webserver has been added.
	  <http://httpd.apache.org/>
	* A plugin to collect statistics about virtual servers using VServer.
	  <http://linux-vserver.org/> Thanks to Sebastian Harl for writing
	  this plugin :)
	* A plugin for wireless LAN cards has been added. It monitors signal
	  strength, link quality and noise ratio..
	* A plugin for Apple hardware sensors has been added.
	* An option to compile collectd with different `step' and `hearbeat'
	  settings has been added. The size of RRAs is no longer static but
	  calculated based on the settings for `step' and `width'.
	* The `ping' plugin can now be configured to use a certain TTL.
	* A plugin to monitor the hardware sensors of Apple computers has been
	  added.
	* The plugins `cpu', `memory', `processes' and `traffic' have been
	  ported to Mach/Darwin (Mac OS X).
	* The `log mode' has been contributed by Christophe Kalt. It writes
	  the data into text files rather than RRD files.

2006-04-09, Version 3.8.4
	* Applied patch by Vincent Stehlé which improves the disk-name
	  resolution in the `hddtemp' plugin for Linux systems.

2006-04-02, Version 3.8.3
	* Applied a patch by James Byers: The MySQL plugin was not working
	  with MySQL 5.0.2 or later.

2006-03-14, Version 3.8.2
	* `utils_mount.c' has been changed to not use the `MNTTAB' defined by
	  the GNU libc, because it points to `/etc/fstab' rather than
	  `/etc/mtab'.

2006-03-13, Version 3.8.1
	* Fixes for building collectd unter FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Solaris.
	* Fixes in the debian `postinst' and `init.d' scripts.

2006-03-09, Version 3.8.0
	* The `ping' plugin no longer uses `libping' but a self written
	  library named `liboping'. With this library it's possible to ping
	  multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and hostnames - in parallel.

2006-02-18, Version 3.7.2
	* A simple bug in the `battery' plugin has been fixed. It should now
	  work with ACPI based batteries as well. Thankt to Sebastian for
	  fixing this.
	* Fixing a bug that prevented collectd to be built without librrd.
	  Thanks to Werner Heuser for reporting it.

2006-02-04, Version 3.7.1
	* The new network code has been improved to build with older versions
	  of glibc.
	* Fix in `libping' sets the ICMP sequence on outgoing packets. Thanks
	  to Tommie Gannert for this patch.

2006-01-30, Version 3.7.0
	* The `battery' plugin has been added. It collects information about
	  laptop batteries..
	* The MySQL plugin has been improved: It now writes two more RRD
	  files, `mysql_qcache.rrd' and `mysql_threads.rrd'.
	* The `cpufreq' plugin now reads another file since the file it did
	  read so far causes much overhead in the kernel. Also, you need root
	  to read the old file, but not to read the new one.
	* The `hddtemp' plugin can now be configured to connect to another
	  address and/or port than localhost.
	* The `df' plugin now prefers `statvfs' over `statfs'.
	* The network code has been rewritten. collectd now supports unicast
	  and multicast, and IPv4 and IPv6. Also, the TTL of sent packages can
	  be set in the configfile.

2006-01-24, Version 3.6.2
	* Due to a bug in the configfile handling collectd wouldn't start in
	  client mode. This released fixes this.

2006-01-20, Version 3.6.1
	* Due to a bug in `configure.in' all modules and the binary were
	  linked against `libmysqlclient'. This issue is solved by this
	  release.

2006-01-17, Version 3.6.0
	* A config file has been added. This allows for loading only specific
	  plugins.
	* A `df' plugin has been added.
	* A `mysql' plugin has been added.
	* The `ping' plugin doesn't entirely give up hope when a socket error
	  occured, but will back of and increase the intervals between tries.

2006-01-21, Version 3.5.2
	* Fixed yet another bug in the signal handling.. Stupid typo..
	* Improved the ping plugin to not give up on socket errors (backport
	  from 3.6.0).

2005-12-18, Version 3.5.1
	* The PID-file is now deleted correctly when shutting down the daemon.
	* SIGINT and SIGTERM are now handled correctly.

2005-12-16, Version 3.5.0 (Revision 326)
	* A bug in the `load' module under Solaris has been fixed.
	* The `users' module has been contributed by Sebastian Harl. It counts
	  currently logged in users.
	* The CPU module now works under FreeBSD without the use of
	  `libstatgrab', however SMP support is missing.
	* The default directories for the RRD files and the PID file now
	  depend on the compile time setting of `localstatedir'.

2005-11-15, Version 3.4.0 (Revision 236)
	* A PID-file is written to /var/run upon startup. Thanks to `Tommie'
	  from gentoo's bugzilla for writing the patch.
	* The build dependency for librrd has been removed. Binaries built
	  without librrd are client-only and will multicast their value as
	  with the `-c' argument.
	* A patch by Peter Holik adds a module for monitoring CPU frequencies.
	* The newly introduced `-f' switch prevents daemon initialization
	  (forking, closing standard filehandles, etc.) Thanks to Alvaro
	  Barcellos for this patch.

2005-11-04, Version 3.3.0 (Revision 216)
	* New modules have been added:
	  - `serial', for monitoring traffic on the serial interfaces
	  - `nfs', for graphing NFS procedure calls
	  - `tape', traffic from/to tape devices
	* The the memory.rrd now accepts more than 4Gig of memory.

2005-10-26, Version 3.2.0 (Revision 200)
	* Support for graphing the processes has been added (thanks to Lyonel
	  Vincent)
	* If reading from hddtemp failes collectd will increase the time
	  between polls up to one day.
	* The init.d files have been improved.
	* Problems with the spec file have been fixed.

2005-10-16, Version 3.1.0 (Revision 194)
	* Added the `setsid' syscall to the startup code.
	* Support for hddtemp has been added (thanks to Vincent Stehlé)

2005-09-30, Version 3.0.0 (Revision 184)
	* The ability to send/receive data to/from the network (think
	  multicast) has been added.
	* Modules have been split up into shared libraries can be loaded at
	  runtime. The biggest advantage is that the core program doesn't need
	  to be linked against an external library.
	* A patch by George Kargiotakis has been applied: It fixes the sensors
	  behaviour then more than one sensor is being queried.

2005-09-16, Version 2.1.0 (Revision 172)
	* A module for swap statistics has been added.

2005-09-09, Version 2.0.0 (Revision 135)
	* Filenames can no longer be configured at program startup. The only
	  options as of this version are the directory and ping hosts.
	* CPU statistics now include Wait-IO. If privided under Linux IRQ and
	  Soft-IRQ statistics are added to `System'. 
	* Diskstats now collect read and write bytes, not sectors.
	* Ping statistics can now be collected for more than one host. There
	  is no default any more: If no host is given no host will be pinged.
	* A self-written patch for libping has been applied so it builds
	  cleanly.

2005-09-01, Version 1.8.1 (Revision 123)
	* Much improved configure-script: libraries and features may now be
	  disabled.
	* More detailed warnings/error messages when RRD update failes.

2005-08-29, Version 1.8.0:
	* Support for collecting disk statistics under Solaris.

2005-08-25, Version 1.7.0:
	* Support for libstatgrab[1] for load, memory usage and network
	  traffic. CPU- and disk-usage are not (yet) supported, since
	  libstatgrab returns insufficient information. I will contact the
	  authors.
	* Improved the CPU-initialization code for Solaris. Apparently CPUs
	  aren't neccessarily counted linear which is now handled correctly.
	[1]: http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/

2005-08-21, Version 1.6.0:
	* Basic support for Solaris: System load and cpu-usage can be
	  collected unter Solaris, too. Other stats will follow later.
	* Many fixes in the autoconf-script
	* Collection/Museum scripts have been added unter contrib/museum
	* collectd may now be started in unprivileged mode, though ping
	  statistics will not work.

2005-07-17, Version 1.5.1:
	* Diskstats-RRDs now use major/minor for naming. Some systems have
	  weird strings as disk-names..

2005-07-17, Version 1.5:
	* A new module, diskstats, has been added. It collects information
	  about the disks and partitions.

2005-07-11, Version 1.4.2:
	* The meminfo mofule has been changed to work with more platforms
	  and/or kernel versions.

2005-07-10, Version 1.4.1: Correct traffic stats
	* The traffic rrd-file is now created with DS-type `COUNTER' which I
	  forgot to correct when I changed that module.

2005-07-09, Version 1.4: More traffic stats
	* Traffic is now collected for all interfaces that can be found
	* Temperature-statistics are read from lm-sensors if available

2005-07-08, Version 1.3: CPU stats
	* Collecting CPU statistics now

2004-07-12, Version 1.2: Using syslog
	* collectd is now using the syslog facility to report errors, warnings
	  and the like..
	* The default directory is now /var/db/collectd

2004-07-10, Version 1.1: Minor changes
	* Nothing really usefull to say ;)

2004-07-09, Version 1.0: Initial Version
	* The following modules are provided:
	  * Load average
	  * Ping time
	  * Traffic
