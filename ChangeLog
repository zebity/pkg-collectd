2007-06-19, Version 4.0.3
	* cpu plugin: Fix the Darwin / Mac OS X code.
	* ping plugin: Use the return value of `getpid', not its address.
	* csv, rrdtool plugin: Fixed a bug that prevented an buffer to be
	  initialized correctly.
	* configure: Added `--with-nan-emulation' to aid cross compilation.

2007-06-12, Version 4.0.2
	* hddtemp and ntpd plugin: Corrected the parsing of port numbers when
	  they're given in numerically form.

2007-06-07, Version 4.0.1
	* iptables plugin: A bug in the configuration routine has been fixed.
	  Setting a comment in the configfile will no longer cause a
	  segmentation fault.

2007-06-03, Version 4.0.0
	* collectd: The plugin-infrastructure has been changed to allow for
	  more types of plugins, namely `write' and `log' plugins.
	* collectd: The read-function has been changed to read many plugins in
	  parallel, using threads. Thus, plugins generally need to use
	  thread-safe functions from now on.
	* collectd: The '-t' command line options allows to perform syntax tests
	  of the configuration file and exit immediately.
	* csv plugin: The new `csv' plugin handles output to `comma separated
	  values'-files.
	* rrdtool plugin: The new `rrdtool' plugin handles output to
	  RRD-files. Data can be cached to combine multiple updates into one
	  write to increase IO-performance.
	* network plugin: The new `network' plugin handles IO via the network.
	  It implements a different, much more extensible protocol which can
	  combine many values in one packet, decreasing the number of UDP-
	  packets being sent. It can read from and send to the network and
	  with the appropriate configuration even forward packets to other
	  networks.
	* unixsock plugin: The new `unixsock' plugin provides an interface to
	  communicate with the daemon while it is running. Right now the
	  commands `GETVAL' and `PUTVAL' are implemented, but more are to
	  come.
	* perl plugin: The new `perl' plugin allows you to write extensions
	  for collectd in the scripting-language Perl.
	* logfile plugin: The new `logfile' plugin writes logmessages to files
	  or STDOUT or STDERR.
	* syslog plugin: The new `syslog' plugin sends logmessages to the
	  system's syslog daemon.
	* entropy plugin: The new `entropy' plugin collects the amount of
	  entropy currently being available to the system.
	* exec plugin: The new `exec' plugin forks child processes and reads
	  back values provided by the forked processes.
	* iptables plugin: The new `iptables' plugin reads counters from
	  iptables rules. Thanks to Sjoerd van der Berg for contributing this
	  plugin.
	* irq plugin: The new `irq' plugin collects the IRQ-counters. Thanks
	  to Peter Holik for contributing this plugin.
	* nut plugin: The new `nut' plugin connects the upsd of the `network
	  ups tools' and reads information about the connected UPS.
	* apache plugin: Support for lighttpd's `BusyServers' (aka.
	  connections) field was added by Florent Monbillard.
	* collectd-nagios: The new `collectd-nagios' binary queries values
	  from collectd, parses them and exits according to Nagios-standards.
	* manpages: The manpages have been improved a lot.

2007-05-29, Version 3.11.5
	* configure: Added `AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' for LFS.
	* ntpd plugin: Fix a potential buffer overflow.
	* processes plugin: Fix a bug when run under Linux 2.4. All processes
	  were accounted as `zombies'.

2007-04-10, Version 3.11.4
	* dns plugin: Change the order of includes to make the plugin compile
	  under FreeBSD.

2007-03-30, Version 3.11.3
	* configure: Have the configure-script define `HAVE_LIBKSTAT' instead
	  of the unused `COLLECT_KSTAT'.

2007-02-11, Version 3.11.2
	* plugin: Catch NULL-pointer and try to fix them. Otherwise the
	  NULL-pointer may have been passed to `printf' which causes a
	  segfault with some libcs.

2007-02-10, Version 3.11.1
	* df plugin: Some wrong defines have been fixed so the plugin works
	  under Solaris again.
	* dns plugin: The usage of a struct has been fixed to work with
	  non-GNU libcs.
	* processes plugin: Some missing defines have been added so the plugin
	  compiles cleanly under FreeBSD and presumably other UNIXes.

2006-12-22, Version 3.11.0
	* collectd: The new command line option `-P' makes it easier for
	  distributors to change the location of PID-files.
	* collectd: The daemon shuts down faster now which makes it easier to
	  write init.d-scripts for it.
	* apache plugin: Increase the buffersize to 16k, because the 4k buffer
	  caused problems every now and then.
	* df plugin: New config options allow to ignore certain mountpoints,
	  filesystem types or devices.
	* dns plugin: The new dns plugin uses `libpcap' to capture DNS traffic
	  and interprets it. It collects traffic as well as qtype, opcode and
	  rcode counts.
	* email plugin: Sebastian Harl has contributed this plugin which
	  counts received mails in categories (e. g. ham, spam, virus), spam
	  score (as given by SpamAssassin) and check types.
	* mbmon plugin: Flavio Stanchina has contributed this plugin which
	  uses `mbmon' to gather information from sensors on the motherboard.
	* processes plugin: Collect detailed statistics for configured
	  processes, that's process and thread count, CPU usage, resident
	  segment size and pagefaults.
	* multimeter plugin: Peter Holik contributed a new plugin which
	  queries multimeters.
	* sensors plugin: Lubos Stanek has put much effort into improving this
	  plugin, including `extended naming', collection of voltage values
	  and the possibility to ignore certain values.

2006-12-21, Version 3.10.4
	* Max Kellermann has identified a bug in the server routine: When
	  opening a socket fails the daemon will (re)try opening the socket in
	  an endless loop, ultimately leading to a `EMFILE' error.

2006-11-04, Version 3.10.3
	* Lubos Stanek has identified a bug in the ntpd-plugin: When the
	  ntpd's reply was sent in more than one packet, the buffer size was
	  calculated incorrectly, resulting in the reading of uninitialized or
	  freed memory.

2006-11-01, Version 3.10.2
	* The sample config file has been improved.
	* Errors in the manpages have been corrected.
	* The ping-plugin now adds hosts during initialization, not during
	  startup. This speeds up starup when no network connectivity is
	  available. Also, the hosts are being added later when the network is
	  available.
	* Improved BSD-support for the df-plugin.
	* Fixed syntax errors in the swap-plugin for Mac OS X.
	* Fix a wrong structure being passed to `getnameinfo' in the ntpd-
	  plugin.
	* Don't disable the mysql-plugin if connecting to the database fails
	  during initialization. Instead, try again in increasing intervals.

2006-07-19, Version 3.10.1
	* A bug in the apcups plugin was fixed: Is the plugin is loaded, but
	  the apcups cannot be reached, unconnected sockets will pile up and
	  eventually lead to `Too many open files' errors.

2006-07-09, Version 3.10.0
	* The `disk' plugin has been ported to Darwin.
	* The `battery' plugin should work on many Apple computers now.
	* The `traffic' plugin can now ignore certain interfaces. Also,
	  statistics for sent/received packets and errors have been added.
	* A plugin to monitor APC UPSes using `apcupsd' has been added. Thanks
	  to Anthony Gialluca for contributing this plugin and providing me
	  with a test environment :)
	* A plugin for moniroting an NTP instance and the local clock drift
	  has been added.

2006-06-25, Version 3.9.4
	* The Solaris code in the `swap' plugin has been changed to reflect
	  the numbers returned by `swap -s'. Thanks to Christophe Kalt for
	  working this out.
	* The debugging system has been fixed to work with the Sun libc.
	* When built without librrd the variable `operating_mode' could be
	  uninitialized. Thanks to David Elliot for reporting the bug.

2006-06-01, Version 3.9.3
	* Fixed the ping-plugin under FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Potentially other
	  operating systems also profit from the changes, but I wasn't able to
	  check that.
	* Changed the build system to find the netinet-includes under FreeBSD
	  and therefore successfully build the `liboping' library there.

2006-05-09, Version 3.9.2
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-05-09, Version 3.8.5
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-04-21, Version 3.9.1
	* Build issues with Solaris and possible other architectures have been
	  resolved.
	* Problems when building the `apache'-plugin without `libcurl' have
	  been resolved.
	* A bug in the `ping' plugin has been fixed. Sorry folks.

2006-04-02, Version 3.9.0
	* A plugin to monitor the Apache webserver has been added.
	  <http://httpd.apache.org/>
	* A plugin to collect statistics about virtual servers using VServer.
	  <http://linux-vserver.org/> Thanks to Sebastian Harl for writing
	  this plugin :)
	* A plugin for wireless LAN cards has been added. It monitors signal
	  strength, link quality and noise ratio..
	* A plugin for Apple hardware sensors has been added.
	* An option to compile collectd with different `step' and `hearbeat'
	  settings has been added. The size of RRAs is no longer static but
	  calculated based on the settings for `step' and `width'.
	* The `ping' plugin can now be configured to use a certain TTL.
	* A plugin to monitor the hardware sensors of Apple computers has been
	  added.
	* The plugins `cpu', `memory', `processes' and `traffic' have been
	  ported to Mach/Darwin (Mac OS X).
	* The `log mode' has been contributed by Christophe Kalt. It writes
	  the data into text files rather than RRD files.

2006-04-09, Version 3.8.4
	* Applied patch by Vincent Stehlé which improves the disk-name
	  resolution in the `hddtemp' plugin for Linux systems.

2006-04-02, Version 3.8.3
	* Applied a patch by James Byers: The MySQL plugin was not working
	  with MySQL 5.0.2 or later.

2006-03-14, Version 3.8.2
	* `utils_mount.c' has been changed to not use the `MNTTAB' defined by
	  the GNU libc, because it points to `/etc/fstab' rather than
	  `/etc/mtab'.

2006-03-13, Version 3.8.1
	* Fixes for building collectd unter FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Solaris.
	* Fixes in the debian `postinst' and `init.d' scripts.

2006-03-09, Version 3.8.0
	* The `ping' plugin no longer uses `libping' but a self written
	  library named `liboping'. With this library it's possible to ping
	  multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and hostnames - in parallel.

2006-02-18, Version 3.7.2
	* A simple bug in the `battery' plugin has been fixed. It should now
	  work with ACPI based batteries as well. Thankt to Sebastian for
	  fixing this.
	* Fixing a bug that prevented collectd to be built without librrd.
	  Thanks to Werner Heuser for reporting it.

2006-02-04, Version 3.7.1
	* The new network code has been improved to build with older versions
	  of glibc.
	* Fix in `libping' sets the ICMP sequence on outgoing packets. Thanks
	  to Tommie Gannert for this patch.

2006-01-30, Version 3.7.0
	* The `battery' plugin has been added. It collects information about
	  laptop batteries..
	* The MySQL plugin has been improved: It now writes two more RRD
	  files, `mysql_qcache.rrd' and `mysql_threads.rrd'.
	* The `cpufreq' plugin now reads another file since the file it did
	  read so far causes much overhead in the kernel. Also, you need root
	  to read the old file, but not to read the new one.
	* The `hddtemp' plugin can now be configured to connect to another
	  address and/or port than localhost.
	* The `df' plugin now prefers `statvfs' over `statfs'.
	* The network code has been rewritten. collectd now supports unicast
	  and multicast, and IPv4 and IPv6. Also, the TTL of sent packages can
	  be set in the configfile.

2006-01-24, Version 3.6.2
	* Due to a bug in the configfile handling collectd wouldn't start in
	  client mode. This released fixes this.

2006-01-20, Version 3.6.1
	* Due to a bug in `configure.in' all modules and the binary were
	  linked against `libmysqlclient'. This issue is solved by this
	  release.

2006-01-17, Version 3.6.0
	* A config file has been added. This allows for loading only specific
	  plugins.
	* A `df' plugin has been added.
	* A `mysql' plugin has been added.
	* The `ping' plugin doesn't entirely give up hope when a socket error
	  occured, but will back of and increase the intervals between tries.

2006-01-21, Version 3.5.2
	* Fixed yet another bug in the signal handling.. Stupid typo..
	* Improved the ping plugin to not give up on socket errors (backport
	  from 3.6.0).

2005-12-18, Version 3.5.1
	* The PID-file is now deleted correctly when shutting down the daemon.
	* SIGINT and SIGTERM are now handled correctly.

2005-12-16, Version 3.5.0 (Revision 326)
	* A bug in the `load' module under Solaris has been fixed.
	* The `users' module has been contributed by Sebastian Harl. It counts
	  currently logged in users.
	* The CPU module now works under FreeBSD without the use of
	  `libstatgrab', however SMP support is missing.
	* The default directories for the RRD files and the PID file now
	  depend on the compile time setting of `localstatedir'.

2005-11-15, Version 3.4.0 (Revision 236)
	* A PID-file is written to /var/run upon startup. Thanks to `Tommie'
	  from gentoo's bugzilla for writing the patch.
	* The build dependency for librrd has been removed. Binaries built
	  without librrd are client-only and will multicast their value as
	  with the `-c' argument.
	* A patch by Peter Holik adds a module for monitoring CPU frequencies.
	* The newly introduced `-f' switch prevents daemon initialization
	  (forking, closing standard filehandles, etc.) Thanks to Alvaro
	  Barcellos for this patch.

2005-11-04, Version 3.3.0 (Revision 216)
	* New modules have been added:
	  - `serial', for monitoring traffic on the serial interfaces
	  - `nfs', for graphing NFS procedure calls
	  - `tape', traffic from/to tape devices
	* The the memory.rrd now accepts more than 4Gig of memory.

2005-10-26, Version 3.2.0 (Revision 200)
	* Support for graphing the processes has been added (thanks to Lyonel
	  Vincent)
	* If reading from hddtemp failes collectd will increase the time
	  between polls up to one day.
	* The init.d files have been improved.
	* Problems with the spec file have been fixed.

2005-10-16, Version 3.1.0 (Revision 194)
	* Added the `setsid' syscall to the startup code.
	* Support for hddtemp has been added (thanks to Vincent Stehlé)

2005-09-30, Version 3.0.0 (Revision 184)
	* The ability to send/receive data to/from the network (think
	  multicast) has been added.
	* Modules have been split up into shared libraries can be loaded at
	  runtime. The biggest advantage is that the core program doesn't need
	  to be linked against an external library.
	* A patch by George Kargiotakis has been applied: It fixes the sensors
	  behaviour then more than one sensor is being queried.

2005-09-16, Version 2.1.0 (Revision 172)
	* A module for swap statistics has been added.

2005-09-09, Version 2.0.0 (Revision 135)
	* Filenames can no longer be configured at program startup. The only
	  options as of this version are the directory and ping hosts.
	* CPU statistics now include Wait-IO. If privided under Linux IRQ and
	  Soft-IRQ statistics are added to `System'. 
	* Diskstats now collect read and write bytes, not sectors.
	* Ping statistics can now be collected for more than one host. There
	  is no default any more: If no host is given no host will be pinged.
	* A self-written patch for libping has been applied so it builds
	  cleanly.

2005-09-01, Version 1.8.1 (Revision 123)
	* Much improved configure-script: libraries and features may now be
	  disabled.
	* More detailed warnings/error messages when RRD update failes.

2005-08-29, Version 1.8.0:
	* Support for collecting disk statistics under Solaris.

2005-08-25, Version 1.7.0:
	* Support for libstatgrab[1] for load, memory usage and network
	  traffic. CPU- and disk-usage are not (yet) supported, since
	  libstatgrab returns insufficient information. I will contact the
	  authors.
	* Improved the CPU-initialization code for Solaris. Apparently CPUs
	  aren't neccessarily counted linear which is now handled correctly.
	[1]: http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/

2005-08-21, Version 1.6.0:
	* Basic support for Solaris: System load and cpu-usage can be
	  collected unter Solaris, too. Other stats will follow later.
	* Many fixes in the autoconf-script
	* Collection/Museum scripts have been added unter contrib/museum
	* collectd may now be started in unprivileged mode, though ping
	  statistics will not work.

2005-07-17, Version 1.5.1:
	* Diskstats-RRDs now use major/minor for naming. Some systems have
	  weird strings as disk-names..

2005-07-17, Version 1.5:
	* A new module, diskstats, has been added. It collects information
	  about the disks and partitions.

2005-07-11, Version 1.4.2:
	* The meminfo mofule has been changed to work with more platforms
	  and/or kernel versions.

2005-07-10, Version 1.4.1: Correct traffic stats
	* The traffic rrd-file is now created with DS-type `COUNTER' which I
	  forgot to correct when I changed that module.

2005-07-09, Version 1.4: More traffic stats
	* Traffic is now collected for all interfaces that can be found
	* Temperature-statistics are read from lm-sensors if available

2005-07-08, Version 1.3: CPU stats
	* Collecting CPU statistics now

2004-07-12, Version 1.2: Using syslog
	* collectd is now using the syslog facility to report errors, warnings
	  and the like..
	* The default directory is now /var/db/collectd

2004-07-10, Version 1.1: Minor changes
	* Nothing really usefull to say ;)

2004-07-09, Version 1.0: Initial Version
	* The following modules are provided:
	  * Load average
	  * Ping time
	  * Traffic
	  * Memory info
