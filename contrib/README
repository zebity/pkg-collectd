The files in this directory may be used to perform common tasks that aren't
exactly `collectd's job. They may or may not require in-depth knowlege of RRD
files and/or `collectd's inner workings. Use at your own risk.

add_rra.sh
----------
  Before version 3.9.0 collectd used to create a different set of RRAs. The
most detailed of these old RRAs hat a one minute resolution. This script can be
used to add three more RRAs: minimum, maximum and average with a ten second
resolution and 2200 rows (~6 hours). This will make houly statistics much more
interesting. Please note that no sanity- checking whatsoever is performed. You
can seriously fuck up your RRD files if you don't know what you're doing.

collectd2html.pl
----------------
  This script by Vincent Stehlé will search for RRD files in
`/var/lib/collectd/' and generate an HTML file and a directory containing
several PNG files which are graphs of the RRD files found.

collectd.conf
-------------
  A sample config file. Used by the Debian package.

collection.cgi
--------------
  Sample CGI script that creates graphs on the fly. The Perl module `RRDs' is
needed (Debian package `librrds-perl').

init.d-rh7
----------
  Sample init script. Used by the RPM specfile.
